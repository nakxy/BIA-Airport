The AMQP specification is loaded before any communication to the server happens. The specifications provided by bramqp are provided by RabbitMQ and are available [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/protocol.html). 

In addition to this xml specification, a list of valueTypes is needed.  This list is maintained in [valueTypes.js](../lib/valueTypes.js).
